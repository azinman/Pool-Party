 * to validate the change by having their {@link #validate} method called.
 * If any <code>validate</code> method throws a <code>ValidationException</code>,
 * the change is aborted, and the exception is thrown to the code that tried
 * to make that change. If all of the <code>validate</code> methods return
 * successfully, the {@link #commit} methods will be called to confirm that
